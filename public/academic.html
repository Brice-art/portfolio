    <h1>Academic Background</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>I am a civil engineering student in the Faculty of Engineering, Department of Environmental and Social Design, at Saitama University in Japan, where I focus on sustainable infrastructure and urban planning. Before joining Saitama University in April 2023, I completed an associate degree in civil engineering at Nagaoka National College of Technology, specializing in Environmental Urban Engineering from April 2020 to March 2023.</p>
    <p>During my time at Nagaoka, I conducted research titled "Strength Characteristics of Cross-Sectional Columns Made of SUS316 Stainless Steel." This study focused on addressing corrosion issues in bridge structures by exploring the strength properties of SUS316 stainless steel cross-sectional columns through numerical analysis. My findings highlighted SUS316â€™s potential as a durable alternative to traditional carbon steel, with enhanced corrosion resistance and ductility that could extend the lifespan of civil structures, especially in harsh environments.</p>
    <p>My educational journey in Japan began at the Tokyo Japanese Language Education Center, where I prepared for academic life in a new language and culture. Before coming to Japan, I studied Mathematics at Ecole des Sciences de Byimana in Rwanda, building the analytical foundation that has supported my engineering studies. I look forward to leveraging this academic background to make a meaningful impact in civil engineering or expand my skills in tech fields such as software development and data analysis.</p>
