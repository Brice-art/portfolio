    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>Welcome to my personal portfolio! My name is BYIRINGIRO BRICE ALI, and I’m a civil engineering student at Saitama University in Japan. Originally from Rwanda, I’ve been living in Japan for the past five years, where I’ve pursued my passion for engineering and broadened my interests into tech and innovation. I completed an associate degree in civil engineering and am currently studying in the Department of Environmental and Social Design, building a strong foundation in urban engineering.</p>
    <p>As a dedicated sports fan, I have a particular interest in soccer and basketball, and I play basketball in my free time. Music is also a big part of my life; I love afrobeats and enjoy Rwandan pop and hip-hop, which keep me connected to my roots. Lately, I’ve also been exploring gengetone and arbantone.</p>
    <p>In addition to my enthusiasm for civil engineering, I’m eager to expand my skill set in software development and data analysis, with the aim of entering a tech field where I can merge my interests in engineering and technology. In the future, I hope to work at a global company, applying my unique blend of technical knowledge and intercultural experience to make a meaningful impact. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to connecting with you!</p>
